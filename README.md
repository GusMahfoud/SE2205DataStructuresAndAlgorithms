**Data Structures and Algorithms in Java:**

Welcome to the repository for the Data Structures and Algorithms in Java class. 
This collection of resources encapsulates the fundamental concepts and practical implementations of various data structures and algorithms using Java. 
Here's what each module covers:

**Generics:**
- Understand how to use generics to write flexible and reusable code.
- This module focuses on generic methods and classes which are crucial for implementing data structures.

**Collision Resolution and Hashing:**
- Dive into hash tables and learn about collision resolution techniques such as chaining and open addressing.
- You'll grasp the inner workings of hashing and how it's used to efficiently store and retrieve data.

**Sorting Algorithms and Big-O Notation:**
- Explore the world of sorting algorithms â€” from bubble sort to quicksort.
- Learn about their efficiencies and how to analyze them using Big-O notation to understand their performance implications.

**Airplane Boarding System Using Linear Data Structures:**
- A practical implementation using queues and arrays to simulate an airplane boarding system, showcasing the use of linear data structures in real-world applications.

**Doubly Linked List and Comparators:**
- Implement doubly linked lists and understand their advantages over singly linked lists.
- Use comparators to sort and manage data within these lists effectively.

**Stack and Queue Data Structures:**
- Learn the principles of 'Last In, First Out' (LIFO) with stacks and 'First In, First Out' (FIFO) with queues.
- These fundamental data structures are the backbone of many complex algorithms and systems.
